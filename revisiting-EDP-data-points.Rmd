## Overview

We are curious about the comparison between the two estimation methods:

+ least-square
+ Hierarchical Bayesian
+ Bayesian

## EDP data

We load the data of 87 subjects.
The data contains $[x^-_8, ..., x^-_1, x_1^+, ..., x_8^+]$ and the $\alpha, \beta$ estimated with lest square method.
